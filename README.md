# rust-fruit
 List of easy open source contributions for beginners
# Why
Rust is Hard, only way to learn is to get involved by contributing and having your code reviewed.

# What
Wanted to compile a list of easy open source issues that begineers looking to contribute to Rust can take on. The app polls github api to aggregate a bunch of 'Easy' tikets. The app refrshes the list every 20 hours to get new issues and remove closed issues.
